**Context of the project**

To facilitate the obtaining of the driving license in Morocco, Narsa has launched a tender for the creation of a desktop application that will be deployed in all Narsa networks in Morocco.

To do this you are invited to create a multi-platform desktop application in Electron Js that will allow you to:

choose the type of license that he will pass, for example the candidate must choose between car license type B or truck type A

the candidate must answer at least 30/40 questions

if the candidate passes the test, a new window appears to register his details

the system records all the information of the admitted candidates

the person in charge of the exam will consult the statistics and the information of each candidate via his interface



Work to do:

Develop your Monpremis application using a DBMS of your choice

Create the necessary code in Node js to record and display the questions of each exam

Deploy your application so that it can be used throughout the Narsa network



NB:

the question can be in text or video form

each question has a 30 seconds counter, if the candidate does not answer in 30 seconds the answer is wrong
